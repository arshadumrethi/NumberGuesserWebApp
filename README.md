Number Guesser app.

This app asks you to guess a number between 1 & 10 and checks if your guess is correct. 

This app uses skeleton boilerplate and was done for DOM manipulation practice.

I practiced using Template Literals, Ternary Operators and Changing DOM elements like buttons, inputs, Assigning and changing text colors.
